There is a test file in the usual place. You can run it using `Netbeans`, by right clicking on it and choosing `Test file` in the `Project view`.

When run, it should use a file named `test.odt` from the Project's resources folder. 
It should open it, make modifications and then save it as `c:\temp\lala.odt`

I have modified it to suit my particular testing needs (adding 33 rows and putting text in one of the cells so that to force it to break across pages).

Then I go and inspect the saved file.
